## Introduction

The Rules Azure Functions refers to a series of Durable functions, that are reponsible for generating the Rules for a given Scan Report Table.

|-------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RulesTrigger            | HttpTrigger  | Consumes the HTTP request from the web app, adds to the queue.                      |
| RulesQueue              | Queue        | Reads the message from the queue, passes to the Orchestrator.                       |
| RulesOrchestrator       | Orchestrator | Orchestrates the activity, generating Concepts, and parallelising Rules Generation. |
| RulesConceptsActivity   | Activity     | Generates the Scan Report Concepts.                                                 |

## Converting Concept Codes to ConceptIDs
### Introduction
Some scan reports (most likely from the larger data providers) will be supplied with concept *codes* as values. In effect the mapping has already been done for us-- we just need to make sure we return valid and standard OMOP conceptIDs. In instances where concept *codes* are provided, they will be coded within a given vocabulary e.g. SNOMED or RxNorm. The ProcessQueue Azure function has therefore been updated with the ability to look up concept codes and convert them to standard and valid OMOP codes. This removes the requirement from the data team of manually looking up concept codes and finding the relevant conceptID.

The Data Team have specified a list of vocabularies that are most likely to be used. 

### Operation
The concept code to conceptID lookup occurs as each scan report value is processed in `__init__.py`. Immediately after a value description is looked up, the code checks to see whether the dictionary contains any information on a vocabulary coding system. A dictionary may look something like:

 csv_file_name  | field_name    | code |value
----------| -------------|----------|---------
  questionnaire | sex  | 0  | male
  survey | question1  | SNOMED | 

In this example, all of the values within the field `question1` will be encoded as SNOMED concept codes. For example, the question might be: "Main symptom" and the answer of 'cough' would be encoded as "49727002" under the SNOMED vocabulary.

For a given value, we determine whether it falls within a field defined as a vocabulary field with:

```python
code = next(
    (
        row["code"]
        for row in data_dictionary
        if str(row["field_name"]) == str(name)
    ),
    None,
)
```
If the value of `code` is within our list of vocabularies, we use `omop_helpers.get_concept_from_concept_code()` to look up the standard and valid OMOP conceptID with the following:

```python
# If 'code' is in our vocab list, try and convert the ScanReportValue (concept code) to conceptID
# If there's a faulty concept code for the vocab, fail gracefully and set concept_id to default (-1)
if code in vocabs:
    try:
        concept_id = omop_helpers.get_concept_from_concept_code(
            concept_code=value,
            vocabulary_id=code,
            no_source_concept=True,
        )
        concept_id = concept_id["concept_id"]
    except:
        concept_id = -1
else:
    concept_id = -1
```

Where `value` is the scan report value (i.e. the concept code) in that loop's iteration and `code` is the name of the vocabulary from the data dictionary's 'code' column (see [here](https://co-connect.ac.uk/co-connect-data-files-and-meta-data-standardisation/) for a standard data dictionary template.) If the supplied scan report value (concept code) is incorrect for any reason, we will simply default to setting `concept_id` to the default of -1.

Here is an example if you wanted to manually look up a concept code:

```python
concept_id = omop_helpers.get_concept_from_concept_code(
                                concept_code=49727002,
                                vocabulary_id="SNOMED,
                                no_source_concept=True,
                            )
```
The argument `no_source_concept` tells the function to not return the non-standard conceptID. It will only return the standard and valid conceptID when this is set to `True`.

With a conceptID in hand, we construct a dictionary called `scan_report_value_entry` with all the necessary details and append it to a list for a single `POST` to the database:

```python

data = []

scan_report_value_entry = {
    "created_at": datetime.utcnow().strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ"),
    "updated_at": datetime.utcnow().strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ"),
    "value": value,
    "frequency": int(frequency),
    "conceptID": concept_id,
    "value_description": val_desc,
    "scan_report_field": names_x_ids[name],
}

data.append(scan_report_value_entry)

```

### Updating ScanReportConcept
By this point, we have not associated conceptIDs with scan report values using the `ScanReportConcept` model. In effect, any conceptID information from the scan report is--at present--held in the model `ScanReportValue`. We therefore need to 'move' the conceptID data from the `conceptID` field and create a record for it in `ScanReportConcept`. 

!!! Important
    The reason we have to do this is--prior to POSTing scan report values to `ScanReportValue`--we have no primary keys for any scan report values. Without the PKs, we can't establish a relationship between `ScanReportValue` and `ScanReportConcept`. After the `POST` request we have the PKs required to associate a `ScanReportConcept` to a `ScanReportValue`.

After POSTing the scan report values to the database, we must then return all `ScanReportValues` where the conceptID != -1. In other words, we want to return all records where we performed a concept code -> conceptID operation. 

We created a custom `ViewSet` called `ScanReportValuePKViewSet` which takes a Scan Report ID and returns all scan report values where there is a conceptID in the `conceptID` field. We then iterate over these model objects and create legitimate concept entries in `ScanReportConcept`
