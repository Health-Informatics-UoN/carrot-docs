Working from the `omopdemo` file from the [University of Dundee SharePoint](https://dmail-my.sharepoint.com/personal/shorban001_dundee_ac_uk/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fshorban001%5Fdundee%5Fac%5Fuk%2FDocuments%2FOMOP%2Fomopdemo%2Eova&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fshorban001%5Fdundee%5Fac%5Fuk%2FDocuments%2FOMOP&originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9kbWFpbC1teS5zaGFyZXBvaW50LmNvbS86dTovZy9wZXJzb25hbC9zaG9yYmFuMDAxX2R1bmRlZV9hY191ay9FVnY4eWZaazJGNUhxTDNqNkJ1ejRtRUJETFdGX0x1QUlDUlNaS0pFMUkyT1VRP3J0aW1lPWotdkJvYXZDMkVn)

To setup the virtual machine you need:

 1. [Oracle VirtualBox Manager](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed and running on your system.  
 1. `omopdemo.ova`  
    1.  It's recommended to extract the raw `omopdemo-disk001.vmdk` file and use this in the installation. `.ova` files are effectively `zip` files and can be extracted with tools like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
    
Once you have these you can run the VirtualBox Manager and create a new virtual machine by clicking `New` and following the installation instructions. Requesting at least 4GB of memory would be recommended.
